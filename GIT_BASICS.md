# 🐙 Git & GitHub Fundamentals

## 🧠 The Concept
Git is a version control system that allows me to track changes and "time travel" through my code history.

## 🛠 Basic Commands
| Command | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `git status` | Check which files are changed or untracked. |
| `git add <file>` | Move a file to the "Staging Area" (the waiting room). |
| `git commit -m "msg"` | Create a permanent snapshot of the staged changes. |
| `git push` | Upload local commits to GitHub. |

## 💡 Pro Tip
Always write **descriptive commit messages**. Instead of "update," use "Add notes on Git terminal commands."
