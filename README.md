# 💻 Technical Engineering Journey & Learning Log

### Documenting the transition from Technical Program Manager to core Software Engineering.

---

## 🎯 The Mission
This repository serves as a centralized, high-density knowledge base for my journey into deep-tier Software Engineering. Utilizing my background in **Technical Program Management**, I am documenting the architectural and logical foundations of modern backend systems.

## 🗺️ Learning Roadmap
To maintain a logical progression, this repository is structured by domain:

* **`00-Setup-and-Workflow`**: Professional environment configuration (Git, SSH, IntelliJ).
* **`01-CS-Fundamentals-C`**: Low-level logic and memory management (via Harvard CS50).
* **`02-Java-Deep-Dive`**: Advanced Java 21, JVM internals, and multithreading.
* **`03-Data-Structures-Algorithms`**: The "Gatekeeper" fundamentals for Big Tech.
* **`04-Backend-Architecture`**: Scalable systems, Spring Boot, and Cloud patterns.

## 🛠️ Engineering Environment
* **Primary IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate (Java Engineering)
* **Systems Editor:** Visual Studio Code (C / Memory Management)
* **Toolchain:** Java 21 LTS & Clang (LLVM)
* **Version Control:** Git / GitHub (SSH Authentication)
* **OS:** macOS (Zsh / Homebrew)
